Project Report




By: Terika Jackson





I.	Abstract

In the contemporary healthcare landscape, small medical clinics and insurance firms face significant challenges in managing patient records securely and efficiently. The "Digital Data Guardian" initiative, aims to address this issue by transitioning these entities from reliance on physical records to a file encrypted electronic health records (EHR) system. This proposal outlines a plan to develop and implement a Python-based encryption and decryption system, enhancing the confidentiality and accessibility of patient data. The solution emphasizes secure storage, robust encryption, stringent access controls, and a user-friendly interface. The implementation involves developing an encryption algorithm, designing an intuitive user interface, providing training and support, and ensuring continuous monitoring and updates. This approach is expected to bolster the safeguarding of sensitive health data, streamline operations, and enhance the overall trust and efficiency in healthcare data management.

II.	Business Problem

Small medical clinics and insurance firms are currently struggling with the management of patient records. The reliance on physical documents not only hampers the efficiency of these organizations but also poses significant risks in terms of data security and accessibility. Patients are often limited to accessing only physical copies of their records, missing the benefits of digitalization. In an era where data breaches are increasingly common, the need for a secure electronic system is paramount.

III.	Business Solution

The Digital Data Guardian project proposes a transition to electronic health records enhanced with a robust file encryption system. This solution will provide the following key features:

1.	Secure Storage and Access: By digitizing patient records, we offer a secure and efficient way to store and access sensitive health data.
2.	Robust Encryption: Implementing an encryption system ensures that patient data is protected from unauthorized access and external threats.
3.	Stringent Access Controls: Access to these digital records will be tightly controlled, ensuring that only authorized personnel can retrieve or modify them.
