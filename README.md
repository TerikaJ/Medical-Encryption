How to set up file encryption/ decryption program in Python IDE
 
Step 1: Create a directory with files for encryption.
Create a file folder with patient records (clinical notes, lab results, images, etc) and label them by: Type, Patient Name, Date (example: Notes-JaneDoe010123)

-	Section 3: User Input Selection Code Menu-driven approach for user interaction:
Choose between encryption, decryption, or quitting the program.
Asking for an integer key and a file extension based on the chosen operation.

















How to perform encryption/decryption on files
 
Step 1: Start New Project on chosen Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Open and select file folder directory that was created with patient records and the python Master Code program script
